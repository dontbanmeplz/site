The chemicals, which included vinyl chloride among others, were burned, releasing potentially toxic fumes into the air. Before that decision was made, however, enough chemicals had leaked into the ground for the EPA to send a legal notice to the rail operator, Norfolk Southern citing concerns over environmental contamination.</p>\r\n<p>Despite this, regulators have repeatedly told residents of East Palestine, Ohio, that they are safe to return to their homes. Information from state and federal regulators have been rife with contradictions, sowing distrust among locals. One resident told The Guardian that the town informed citizens municipal water was safe to drink, then advised purchasing bottled water. That is to say nothing of residents complaining of rashes after showering.</p>\r\n<p>Residents were also left confused when after being assured of their town\u2019s safety, Norfolk Southern offered individual payments of $1,000 to assist evacuation efforts. These payouts have been met with skepticism by legal counsel for some of the residents, noting that the purported \u201cinconvenience fee\u201d might be an effort to force residents to waive future claims against the company.</p>\r\n<p>Ohio Governor Mike DeWine did not end the parade of contradictions after reporting on February 14 that President Joe Biden had offered federal disaster relief assistance, which DeWine reportedly declined. Two days later, DeWine said in a statement that he had requested more aid, but was informed that the city was not eligible for FEMA assistance. Locals report dissatisfaction with the way DeWine has handled the situation, describing his guidance as \u201cnot real reassuring,\u201d according to one NPR interview.</p>\r\n<p>Not all rail cars were carrying toxic chemicals. As a result, Norfolk Southern was not subject to a law that would ordinarily have required the firm to notify Ohio state officials about the train\u2019s contents. The governor\u2019s office has condemned this regulation and called on Congress to amend it.</p>\r\n", "thumbnail_url": "https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIF.khdSnSDk0wSks939rjAAqw?pid=ImgDet&rs=1", "times": 42}, {"id": "8179", "title": "US Shoots Down Unknown High Altitude Object Over Alaska", "excerpt": "Coverage of the recent event in which the USA shot down an unknown object flying over Alaksa.

The former President remains a powerful and influential figure within the party, and many Republicans are reluctant to openly criticize him or move away from his populist agenda.

The contract reportedly offered Crowder $50 million to join the network, with an important caveat. The stipulation to the sweetheart deal was that if Crowder were banned from any online platform, he would take a salary cut. This proved to be intolerable to the intrepid journalist, and he took to Twitter to express his dissatisfaction.\r\nThe Daily Wire quickly responded in video form with the company\u2019s CEO, Jeremy Boreing, going over the contract in-depth and expressing regret that the dispute escalated so severely. This prompted Crowder to take the unprecedented move of posting negotiations made over the phone with Boreing to the internet, a move that was met with condemnation by pundits like Daily Wire\u2019s Candace Owens, who referred to it as a \u201cbitch move.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>In a video discussing the controversy, Crowder took umbrage with the fact that the contract made a 25% cut to his salary if he were to be banned from any Big Tech platforms like Twitter or YouTube Daily Wire claims that it is unreasonable for Crowder to expect the same salary if Crowder\u2019s indiscretions lead to a substantial decrease in the revenue he will bring to the network. The crux of Crowder\u2019s complaint is that the contract essentially acts as an enforcement arm of Big Tech censorship\u2013something Crowder and Daily Wire pundits have vocally opposed in the past. Crowder viewed the clause as cowardly and greedy, accusing the Daily Wire of being \u201cin bed\u201d with Big Tech.</p>\r\n<p>Consumers of conservative media appear divided, after an initial wave of sympathy for Crowder, who was perceived as standing on principle.

The H-2B nonimmigrant program permits capitalists to temporarily hire nonimmigrants (foreign citizens granted work in the USA under a visa), to perform various labor and services in the United States. This dangerous program will hurt working class American citizens by actively displacing them from their workplaces. </p>\r\n<p>Capitalists have laid the claim that U.S. workers looking for long-term employment will not seek out H-2B occupations, however, depressed wages and insincere recruitment efforts make a true test of the U.S. labor market impossible. Various employers have advertised for H-2B labor jobs such as construction, with low wages, and go on to employ the workers to do trucking jobs, worth far more than what their occupational description enticed. Through this program, capitalist employers have intentionally misclassified the occupation to pay at lower wages and exploit workers, while refusing jobs for workers that qualify for the occupation.</p>\r\n<p>A common myth promoted by the government has been that hiring H-2B workers is not cheap. This is a blatant lie to perpetuate exploitation of the working class. DOL data released in 2014 showed that employers were able to save $2.59-$3.80 per hour by hiring H-2B workers, being able to pay them lower wages for labor. Overall studies show that H-2B workers are at the same wage-earnings as undocumented immigrants are in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>Studies have shown that the abuse of workers under H-2B is a systemic issue. In 2015, Indian workers employed under H-2B occupations won $14,000,000 in a lawsuit, for human trafficking and discrimination, fought, Signal International.

By Joshua Lino", "content": "<hr>\r\n<p>There has been a myth in the life of global politics extending across the board since its founding: the notion that race is real. This toxic idea has permeated the fabric of American politics on both ends of the political spectrum. In this article we are going to cover the myth of race and its many pseudoscientific conceptions.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"success-in-correlation-to-race\">Success in correlation to race</h2>\r\n<p>Race realists love to attempt to correlate the amount of European heritage in an African American to the amount of success they appear to have, but fail to realize the fact that correlation does not equal causation. For example the number of people in 2010 who died from tripping and falling correlates roughly 95% with the amount of people who died of drowning in natural water. But nobody would seriously suggest that if you trip and fall, you are more likely to trip and fall into water and drown to death. Again, correlation does not equal causation.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"race-on-a-genetic-basis\">Race on a genetic basis</h2>\r\n<p>The \u201cWorldwide Human Relationships Inferred From Genome-Wide Patterns of Variation\u201d study, is commonly used by race realists in an attempt to say that race can be defined because there are specific genes in some groups which are either more prominent than in other circles, or not there at all in other circles. However the study authors never intended this to be used as a racialist study, and only stated that it <em>could</em> be used to determine one&#39;s ancestry. A graph which has been circulating in correlation to this study in an attempt to say that the African genome is parsed extremely far apart from the European genome, was cited nowhere on the study, and was made up by racialists in an attempt to make differences seem extremely visually prominent. This commonly used study even states that the study does nothing to comment on the origins of phenotypic variations. In fact it states from it\u2019s findings that most diverse gene groups in the human race tend to be the very ethnic groups which race realists love to claim to be so pure and homogenous. In other words, when you get a sub-saharan group, and a swedish group, and put them in a room together, there will on average be more diversity within the sub-saharan african groups and the swedish groups, than there is <em>between</em> these two separate groups.</p>\r\n<p>DNA tests give you information on where your ancestors came from. However, that&#39;s not the same as telling you what your race is. Various adaptations of people based on environments caused them to develop various different adaptations to aid them in survival, and this is what makes certain traits traceable. It doesn\u2019t at all entice that there are various human subgroups. Human subgroups that have attempted to be constructed such as the notions of race, and ethnicity, are divisible however many times you want to divide the categories, by whatever standard you wish to divide them. You can in fact find different ethnic groups within ethnic groups depending on how much you wish to magnify said differences and by which standard. The visual graph mentioned in the previous paragraph spaces apart the races mentioned into 5 groups, however with this previous information in mind, why not parse apart said \u201craces\u201d into 1000, maybe 2000 different ethnic groups. Out of the 1,000,000 genetic differences within the human race, only 70 genes have undergone population-based variations. These ones are relegated to medical-related variations as in tolerance for certain foods, the prevalence of rare and unlikely disorders, and pigmentation, etc etc.</p>\r\n<p>Race realists usually point to various characteristics such as sickle cell anemia, as proof that some genes are race-based. The truth however, is that sickle cell is an adaptation in areas with high rates of malaria, correlated in no way to race. You find it in some areas of Africa, Asia and Europe, at higher and lower rates than in other environments.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"race-and-iq\">Race and IQ</h2>\r\n<p>We find that IQ seems at first to have massive disparities between racial groups, and this may at first seem to be an appealing argument, however when you look ultimately at the environment, things begin to make much more sense. Africa is the second most volatile continent on the planet when it comes to weather and climate. African civilizations had very little chance to develop with those conditions, unlike in Europe in which groups were forced to band together to survive winters, though as well having times of year majoritively which permitted good conditions for agriculture, these conditions don\u2019t exist in much of Africa despite Africa\u2019s abundance in resources which are unable to be tapped into. Within the last 300 years we have seen the average african-descent IQ vary up to 30 points on average depending on region, which is far past the allowed standard deviation, proving that the IQ of african-american communities, and global communities as a whole, are far more based on environment than on genetics. These ranges go as low as 63 in nations such as Ethiopia, to an average of 96 in such cases as in those raised in education in the DoDEA, only another standard deviation away from the highest average Asian IQ, and half of that away from the average white Americans. This disproves that Africans have a high IQ disparity by nature, leaving no room for this fallacious theory. What is more is that this IQ gap, as education has improved, has shrunk greatly since the 80s until now.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"systemic-discrimination\">Systemic discrimination</h2>\r\n<p>Other issues originate from within systems, such as the generational effects of redlining against African-American communities, causing generational poverty, thus underfunding of taxes into African-American dominated school systems due to that poverty, lack of education therein, and the need of crime to bring in alternative income into their communities, thus normalizing violence within many aspects of African-American culture. These system-related issues still affect African-American populations in the USA to this day and is the reason why crime rates are so high within those communities. This problem is only worsened by the vast majority of black characters in media being primarily portrayed as gangsters or sports-stars, and the lack of diversity in the media, intentionally so, of African-American citizens.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>Some issues are not covered here, however, the only thing we can truly find concretely is that there are region-based differences within human populations which show some closer genetic similarities between certain regional demographics than to other ones, however there is no basis for a remotely clear line between these groups on a logical level. People do look different, however ultimately there is no scientific basis to support the notion of race or ethnicity within the scientific community.</p>", "thumbnail_url": "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LtGF1mDe7Ok/TrfVsSpz9RI/AAAAAAAAADw/nlzYwn-41l0/s320/Skulls-+by+race.jpg", "times": 65}, {"id": "2727", "title": "Volodymyr Zelensky Moves To Ban the Ukranian Orthodox Church", "excerpt": "Ukraine's president has called to ban the Ukranian Orthodox Church amid war.

Critics continue to parse the photos for inappropriate symbolism, and as they continue to find examples in abundance, it appears the controversy will not die down anytime soon.</p>\r\n", "thumbnail_url": "https://netrinoimages.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2016/12/18/431639/256729/balenciaga_logo_3d_model_c4d_max_obj_fbx_ma_lwo_3ds_3dm_stl_2696759_o.jpg", "times": 14}, {"id": "6430", "title": "The Consequences for Oregon of Passing Measure 114", "excerpt": "Measure 114, a dangerous new bill attempting to find its way into legislation, may be the end of firearm freedoms in Oregon. Article by Joshua Lino.", "content": "<hr>\r\n<p>Oregon\u2019s measure 114 is a recent firearm policy that is being attempted to be put into action in the state of Oregon by anti-gun billionaires: Connie Ballmer, Nicolas Hanauer, and Michael Bloomberg. This law very much resembles California\u2019s, and many other \u201cblue\u201d state firearm policies. Measure 114 requires a permit from law enforcement directly for people to purchase them. The police force in Oregon is one of the worst in the nation, being grossly underfunded for training as well as their facilities abroad, and vastly understated in comparison with the majority of the USA. This measure would require application for a \u201csafety training course\u201d, of which there are virtually no safety training facilities to be able to participate in within the state of Oregon. It would require the police force 40,000,000 dollars annually to succeed in delivering the required training. Measure 114 as well, requires a criminal background check, and restrictions on magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.</p>\r\n<p>The State of Oregon has undergone massive scrutiny from many of its citizens, so much so that it is now being sued over possible violations of the constitution of the USA. It will be decided by the Secretary of State by the 8th of December, if the legal passing of this legislation is to be delayed or not. Representation of the 2nd amendment of the American Constitution (the right to bear and keep arms) and Oregon\u2019s own Art. I, sec. 27 clause, stating that the people shall have the right to bear arms for the defense of themselves, and the State, but the Military shall be kept in strict subordination to the civil power, will be more than enough to defeat these unjust attempts at legislation.</p>\r\n<p>Portland media is attempting to state that these new restrictions are simply about developing more sufficient background checks. This is a blatant lie. The state of Oregon has had background checks for a very long time. This bill is about much more than simply legislating better and more efficient background checks. This bill is about controlling the citizens of Oregon and forcing the submission of the people of Oregon to an insufficient state of government which has been shown time and time again to repeatedly be the core of the issue plaguing Oregon\u2019s streets. What Oregon\u2019s government wants now is to be able to strip the citizens of their ability to defend themselves, and to relegate their population to downgraded weaponry, which will never be able to defend itself against any inevitably imposed tyranny.</p>\r\n<p>This law, if passed, would leave the poor, the rural, and those in dangerous, perhaps even fatal circumstances, virtually defenseless to protect themselves and their family. There is no possible way that the underfunded Oregonian police would be able to balance these facilities, if they did exist, on their already dwindling and tiring budgets. All we, as fellow Americans, can do, is hope that this legislation will be delayed for now at the very least, and at the very most, that this unlawful and dangerous bill will never see its place in legislation.</p>", "thumbnail_url": "https://preview.redd.it/3etmpddtsa851.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=394fa63b23418ef0eb90152b8846f86aee50c2ca", "times": 20}, {"id": "2879", "title": "GOP \u201cUnexpectedly\u201d Underperforms in Midterms", "excerpt": "An examination of the 2022 midterms, by Rob Mullins", "content": "<hr>\r\n<p>The 2022 midterm elections have proven to be largely disappointing for Republicans, following weeks of predictions of a \u201cred wave\u201d sweeping the country. In an election cycle with a historically unpopular president and record-high inflation, only the GOP could bungle things this badly, because they can\u2019t win for losing. </p>\r\n<p>Divisive candidates, misallocated resources, party division, and lack of a coherent message have squandered what easily should have been a slam dunk for the American right wing. In 2010, halfway into Barack Obama\u2019s first term, his approval rating was almost ten points higher than Joe Biden\u2019s, roughly 49% to 40% respectively. In that year, Republicans gained 63 seats in the House of Representatives, and seven in the Senate.</p>\r\n<p>The nascent right-wing polling firm Trafalgar had an abysmal night made all the more painful after distinguishing itself as the most accurate indicator of Donald Trump\u2019s support in 2016 and 2020. The firm overestimated Republican support in Senate races by an average of 7.5%, according to The Intelligencer. </p>\r\n<p>Mitch McConnell surely did all he could to lower expectations\u2013referring to the Senate as \u201cjust different\u201d than House races when he was asked if he expected to begin the new congress as majority leader. McConnel cited candidate quality as the reason for his reticence, which would turn out to be a prescient concern, aggravated by the inability of inexperienced candidates to fundraise effectively.</p>\r\n<p>Problems with fundraising appear systemic among Republican candidates for federal office. Democratic candidates outraised Republican opponents by an average of 2-to-1 according to campaign finance analysis by the Associated Press. In a few rare cases, the disparity was not insurmountable, as JD Vance, who won the Ohio Senate race by 6 percentage points, was outspent nearly 4-to-1 by his opponent Tim Ryan. Vance was given a boost by the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC strongly aligned with Mitch McConnell.</p>\r\n<p>Complicating McConnell\u2019s efforts to intervene in vulnerable races was the National Republican Senatorial Committee, led by Florida Senator Rick Scott. The two operations operated largely independent of one another, and were worse off as a result. McConnell mobilized early in an effort to fend off unsavory candidates who were viewed as unlikely to win, like New Hampshire\u2019s Don Bolduc.</p>\r\n<p>This effort clearly failed, judging by how many Trump endorsees won GOP primaries, like Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania and Blake Masters in Arizona. The party grassroots do not stand by Mitch McConnell Republicans, that\u2019s obvious. But this alone will not propel right-wing candidates to victory. Senator Scott\u2019s leadership of the NRSC has proven problematic, with a significant amount of money ending up in the hands of consultants with little results to show from it.</p>\r\n<p>It is clear the Republican Party needs to chart a new course. It needs to field candidates with the will and energy to win. It needs to improve fundraising abilities, and disperse funds to vulnerable candidates. What is clear is that it\u2019s no longer viable to throw institutional McConnell money behind faux centrist candidates who will always lose. There needs to be a synthesis between the populists, backed by Scott and Trump, for whom GOP voters have demonstrated strong support, with financial backing by party leaders like McConnell. If party leaders fail to realize this vision, they will look back at the 2022 midterms with nostalgia as they continue to lose both seats in Congress and the support of the nation.</p>\r\n", "thumbnail_url": "https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/iStock-884243522-1000x500.jpg", "times": 15}, {"id": "6791", "title": "Trump Launches 2024 Presidential Campaign", "excerpt": "A concise summary of Trump's 2024 campaign, by Rob Mullins", "content": "<hr>\r\n<p>After losing the popular vote in 2016, losing re-election in 2020, and costing the GOP the Senate majority and several tossup House seats, Donald Trump did the most rational thing in light of this track record: he began his campaign for president in 2024. He announced on November 15th, after a lackluster performance by congressional Republicans in the midterm elections nationwide. </p>\r\n<p>The somewhat muted tone and restrained rhetoric drew mixed reactions from fans and detractors alike. Politico reported that this is an indication that the former president is \u201cno longer having fun.\u201d The low-energy announcement and the failure of hand-picked candidates like Kari Lake and Blake Masters have shaken the GOP\u2019s faith in Trump as leader and kingmaker\u2013and rightfully so.</p>\r\n<p>Trump\u2019s precipitous fall from grace came astonishingly quick. Voter enthusiasm for his third presidential run has not materialized. Even Republican officials are shocked at the lack of engagement. \u201cThe excitement\u2019s just not there,\u201d Saul Anuzis, former chair of the Michigan Republican Party, told Politico. </p>\r\n<p>Although several politicians have expressed an interest in the Republican nomination, right now the only serious threat to Trump comes from Florida governor Ron DeSantis. According to a poll released in November by the conservative pollster Club for Growth, DeSantis leads Trump in a hypothetical primary matchup in the states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Georgia, and Florida.</p>\r\n<p>The numbers in Florida are stark, where DeSantis leads Trump 56% to 30%, according to US News &amp; World Report. DeSantis\u2019s lead hardly shrinks outside his home state; he leads Trump 55% to 35% in Georgia, and 52% to 37% in New Hampshire. If Trump still retained any competent advisors, and it is very unlikely that he does, these results would set off alarm bells.</p>\r\n<p>The Republican Party made much-needed inroads with blue collar Midwestern voters, white women, and Hispanics under Trump\u2019s leadership in 2016. Since that singular win, the GOP has largely languished under the continuing burdens that Trump\u2019s lack of focus has forced on them. Sadly, because the party is now dominated by spineless, out-of-touch sycophants, it does not appear capable of changing course, even with a much more vibrant, virile, and competent potential successor waiting in the wings.</p>\r\n<p>It is apparent that the Republican Party has lost confidence in Donald Trump, a convenient sentiment to emerge after he achieved total control of the party apparatus. This was no cause for complaint when Trump was at the helm and Republicans are winning, but this is clearly no longer the case.</p>\r\n<p>The majority of Trump\u2019s endorsed candidates lost in the midterms. Ann Coulter noted that if Herschel Walker loses, which appears increasingly likely as Georgia\u2019s senate race enters a runoff, it would be the third successive time Trump has caused the loss of what should be an easy GOP pickup in the state.</p>\r\n<p>It\u2019s not as simple as the GOP abandoning Trump either. Without him, the Party will find itself in the same situation it was in 2015 before Trump took over: a party of out-of-touch consultants and figureheads with no political program other than lowering the marginal corporate tax rate. So while it may be easy to blame upcoming Republican losses on Trump, it is important to remember that the Party\u2019s leadership is just as much to blame, and these losses will continue until both Trump and the leadership are replaced.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>Sources:</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/11/17/trump-2022-not-enjoying-himself-00069339\">https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/11/17/trump-2022-not-enjoying-himself-00069339</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/27/republicans-against-trump-2024-00070632\">https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/27/republicans-against-trump-2024-00070632</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2022-11-14/desantis-beats-trump-in-hypothetical-primary-matchups-poll\">https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2022-11-14/desantis-beats-trump-in-hypothetical-primary-matchups-poll</a></p>", "thumbnail_url": "https://media.wired.com/photos/5fa5c014d683a4ea1e288713/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Culture_trump_socialmedia_1229490572.jpg", "times": 15}, {"id": "2413", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Possible Political Fallout After Hosting White Nationalist, Nick Fuentes.

Where does this leave 2024?", "content": "<hr>\r\n<p>Former president, Donald J. Trump, has faced harsh criticism in light of the recent hosting of white nationalist and catholic theocrat, Nick Fuentes. Nick Fuentes was brought as a guest by Kanye West, who has recently undergone heavy media scrutiny after stating that he was going to go \u201cDefcon-3 on the jews.\u201d It\u2019s very likely that West orchestrated this meeting so that Trump would be forced into an awkward situation. West also invited Trump to become his vice president in the recent 2024 presidential race.</p>\r\n<p>After saying that Trump did not know of Fuentes prior to the Mar-a-Lago, but as reported by Kanye, that he was impressed by the young man&#39;s conduct, Trump underwent massive media scrutiny, at which point his vice president for his running race in 2024, Mike Pence called out for Mr Trump to denounce Nick Fuentes, saying \u201cTrump was wrong to give a white nationalist, an antisemite and a Holocaust denier a seat at the table. I think he should apologize for it. I think the president displayed profoundly poor judgment in giving those individuals a seat at the table.\u201d Milo Yiannapolous came out, no pun intended, stating that he was the architect of the entire plan.</p>\r\n<p>But what does this really mean for the republican party? Since the recent split in the GOP between Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, this creates a further schism, and has caused massive damage in Trump\u2019s popularity among the majority of his working class supporters, and has massively attracted far right wing, and overall authoritarian groups, and is likely the first step in a closer bridging between the far-right wing of the USA, and the traditional standard conservative movements. This meeting and it\u2019s implications of Trump\u2019s reputation may have massive repercussions for his ability to succeed in winning the presidential election of 2024, and may jeopardize his ability to win against Ron DeSantis, the present Florida governor formally endorsed by Donald Trump, who has recently committed a sort of political mutiny against the old president, in pursuing his own presidential career.</p>\r\n<p>Whether or not Donald Trump was aware of who Nick Fuentes was, is irrelevant at this point, as the damage has been done. He knows who he is now, and has a political obligation to clarify his relationship with the influencer, if he hopes to be able to save his own career in running in 2024. Overall, Donald Trump has exhibited an awful lack of judgment in this scenario, and some may argue that this very much has proven to make him an untenable candidate for presidency.</p>\r\n", "thumbnail_url": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2155573/comp-photo-donald-trump-nick-fuentes.jpg", "times": 14}, {"id": "3560", "title": "ABOUT", "excerpt": "About the People's American Press.", "content": "<p>The People&#39;s Press of America is a media site designed by working class American citizens to provide quick and easily digestable material, as well as extra political commentary, in a weekly released paper covering geopolitical events.</p>\r\n<p>We aim to publish the truth, the absolute truth and nothing but the truth.
